## Digit-Recognition-Using-CNN : 

In this article, I'll show you how to use scikit-learn to do machine learning classification on the MNIST database of handwritten digits. I'll use and discuss the following methods
The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset consisting of 28x28 grayscale images. For each image, we know the corresponding digits (from 0 to 9).

Neural networks approach the problem in a different way. The idea is to take a large number of handwritten digits, known as training.
It is a digit recognition task. As such there are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict. Results are reported using prediction error, which is nothing more than the inverted classification accuracy.......
