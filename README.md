## Digit-Recognition-Using-CNN : 

In this article, I'll show you how to use scikit-learn to do machine learning classification on the MNIST database of handwritten digits. I'll use and discuss the following methods
The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset consisting of 28x28 grayscale images. For each image, we know the corresponding digits (from 0 to 9).
